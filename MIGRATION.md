# ðŸš€ Migration Guide  

## Breaking changes  
* All files and all namespaces have been replaced from `XCrew.Morpeh` to `Scellecs.Morpeh`.
* All Globals have lost method `NextFrame`. Use `Publish`, which works exactly as `NextFrame` used to. Current-frame Global events are not supported anymore, they are always deferred. The reason for this change is that most projects used both `Publish` + `NextFrame`, or `NextFrame` only.
* `Entity.ID` is not `int` anymore, but `EntityID` which contains `id` and `gen`. This is a mandatory change for Jobs/Burst support. `World.TryGetEntity(EntityId entityId, out Entity entity)` has been added, which allows checking if entity exists without storing direct reference to it.
* `Filter.Length` is removed completely. It has been replaced with `Filter.GetLengthSlow()` and `Filter.IsEmpty()`. This change is made because recalculating Filter length was quite costly, and most of the time filters length was not needed for developers, making it a useless overhead. It's important to note that most length comparisons were used to check if filter is empty or not, so such checks using `IsEmpty()` are as fast as they used to be, but with a different API. This allowed us to make Morpeh much faster in projects which have a lot of different filters.
* Using `entity.RemoveComponent()` clears components immediately now, and reading ref components data after removing said component is prohibited and will lead to unexpected behaviour.
* Iterating `Filter` does not guarantee any order now. If your logic depended on filters returning entities exactly in specific order, it has to be fixed before upgrading.
* `ComponentsBag` has been completely removed. It has been replaced with `ComponentsCache` which also provides full public access to raw components.

## New API  
* Added new component interfaces `IValidatable`, `IValidatableWithGameObject`. It allows calling default Unity method `OnValidate` for components, f.e. to initialize editor fields. Works only for components added via MonoProvider.
* Added support for native Api (Job/Burst). Details are available in [README](README.md#unity-jobs-and-burst). Most work is done via `AsNative()` for:
  * Archetype (NativeArchetype)
  * ComponentsCache (NativeCache)
  * FastList (NativeFastList)
  * IntFastList (NativeIntFastList)
  * Filter (NativeFilter)
  * IntHashMap (NativeIntHashMap)
  * World (NativeWorld)
* Added `IMorpehLogger` interface and static `MLogger` class. It allows overriding logging behaviour for Morpeh. Console.WriteLine is used for all environments by default, except Unity.
* Added `MORPEH_PROFILING` define. Adding it to Player Settings allows profiling systems without using Deep Profile.
* `Entity.Dispose()` is now public. It allows destroying entities without accessing the World it's in.
* Added viewing multiple worlds in World Browser
* Added basic TriInspector support
